## Introduction

Welcome! This online book is an R adaptation of the Canvas content for Research Process for Music Psychologists (MUSI90252) at the University of Melbourne.

This book is under **active development** and is currently incomplete. 

## Credits

This book is under development and a test for me to learn GitHub. So far nothing's broken, although the book is not currently hosted. (I'm yet to figure out how to use GitHub/Gitbook to host bookdown-made books.)

This book was written based on R Markdown and **bookdown** (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown).
