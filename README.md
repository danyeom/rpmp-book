## Introduction

Welcome! This online book is an R adaptation of the Canvas content for Research Process for Music Psychologists (MUSI90252) at the University of Melbourne.

This book is under **active development** and is currently incomplete. There are currently lots of gaps that I either a) haven't transferred from the original subject, b) am yet to adapt to R or c) need to rearrange content to fill given how different some operations in R are compared to Jamovi. (I'm also very new to GitHub so please be gentle.)

The book is hosted at https://danyeom.github.io/rpmp-book.

## Credits

This book was written based on R Markdown and **bookdown** (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown).
