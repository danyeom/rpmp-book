Welcome! 

This online book is an R adaptation of the Canvas content for Research Process for Music Psychologists (MUSI90252) at the University of Melbourne.

This book is under development and a test for me to learn GitHub. So far nothing's broken. Nice!

This is a minimal example of a book based on R Markdown and **bookdown** (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown).
