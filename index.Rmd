# Preface

This is an R adaptation of Modules 5 - 11 of Research Process for Music Psychologists (MUSI90252). 

By and large the content is exactly the same as the Jamovi-focused content in the Canvas shell, except:
- Some commentary has either been added or removed for R-specific material (e.g. information on functions)
- Embedded content, such as that in Module 7, is not available here (but is Jamovi-specific anyway)
- Some content has been reorganised in a minor way because of how R outputs things compared to Jamovi. This mainly affects the content around effect sizes, because often they rely on separate functions in R - but also occurs more often during the ANOVA and linear regression content (due to the fact that the models need to be built first before doing some steps, such as assumptions)

## Usage 

Each **bookdown** chapter is an .Rmd file, and each .Rmd file can contain one (and only one) chapter. A chapter *must* start with a first-level heading: `# A good chapter`, and can contain one (and only one) first-level heading.

Use second-level and higher headings within chapters like: `## A short section` or `### An even shorter section`.

The `index.Rmd` file is required, and is also your first book chapter. It will be the homepage when you render the book.

## Render book

You can render the HTML version of this example book without changing anything:

1. Find the **Build** pane in the RStudio IDE, and

1. Click on **Build Book**, then select your output format, or select "All formats" if you'd like to use multiple formats from the same book source files.

Or build the book from the R console:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# cd C:/Users/yeom7/OneDrive\ -\ The\ University\ of\ Melbourne/Tutoring/RPMP/rpmp_bookdown

bookdown::render_book()
```

To render this example to PDF as a `bookdown::pdf_book`, you'll need to install XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): <https://yihui.org/tinytex/>.

## Preview book

As you work, you may start a local server to live preview this HTML book. This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in "Preview book", or from the R console:

```{r eval=FALSE}
bookdown::serve_book()
```


```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
